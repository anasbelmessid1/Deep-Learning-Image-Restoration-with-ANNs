## Detailed Methodology
### Data Description
The DIV2K dataset, which includes 1,000 high-quality images, was used for training and evaluation. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. The images encompass various scenes and types of degradations to simulate real-world conditions.

### Model Architecture
- **DnCNN**: A specialized CNN designed for denoising tasks. It employs deep convolutional layers and residual learning to effectively suppress noise while preserving image details.
- **CVT**: Combines CNNs and transformers to capture both local and global information for image restoration.
- **PixCNN**: An autoregressive model that generates high-quality restored images by capturing dependencies between pixel values.

### Training
The models were trained using pairs of noisy and clean images. Optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam optimizer were used to minimize loss functions like mean squared error (MSE) and improve the models' denoising performance.

## Results
The DnCNN model demonstrated superior performance in reducing image noise, preserving essential details, and achieving high PSNR and SSIM values compared to other techniques.

## Conclusion
The project successfully developed a robust image restoration model using deep learning techniques. The results indicate significant improvements in image quality, with potential applications in various fields such as medical imaging, surveillance, and digital photography.

## Future Work
Future research could focus on further optimizing the models, exploring additional datasets, and integrating more advanced architectures to enhance the restoration capabilities.
